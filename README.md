# FibreOpticForceTransducer

Ongoing development of a GUI to perform force measurements using a fibre optic sensor. We can proform a sequence of tests in a automated way so that we can study the influcence of velocity or get a spatial map of properties. Force measurements at up to 10Hz are currently possible.

[Documentation](https://github.com/evo-biomech/FibreOpticForceTransducer/blob/main/Documentation/ForceSetup_Manual.zip) for setup and components is provided separately.
