# FibreOpticForceTransducer

Ongoing development of a GUI to perform force measurements using a fibre optic sensor. We can proform a sequence of tests in a automated way so that we can study the influcence of velocity or get a spatial map of properties. Force measurements at up to 10Hz are currently possible.

Documentation for setup and components is provided separately.
